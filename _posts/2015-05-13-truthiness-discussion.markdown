There is an interesting discussion around the Ruby community and predicate
methods. One say they should always return `true` and `false`. Others say, they
should adhere to the truthy and falsy semantics.

I wanna point to an interesting [argument] by [Godfrey Chan] defending the use
of the truthy and falsy semantics. Just some food for thought.
