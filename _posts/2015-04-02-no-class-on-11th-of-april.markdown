title: No Class on 11th of April
category: posts

Hello my dearest friends. I'm writing here to inform you that I haven't read
[The Elements of Style], which you should, unless you wanna express yourself
badly as I do. See all those extra words? They don't add any value.

Anyway, what does add value in this post is that we'll celebrate Easter and
there won't be any class on 11th of April.

Please, spend some time with your loved ones and don't knock on our doors.
We'll be pissed!
