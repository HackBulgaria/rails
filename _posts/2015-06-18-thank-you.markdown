After two amazing months, this class is over. It was pleasure for us to met so
enthusiastic and curious students.

## The Partners

Thanks to our partners, who supported this course - Software Society and
[Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/)! Our classes couldn't be free without them and
we really appreciate their support.

## The Lecturers

Special thanks go to [Radoslav Stankov], [Bozhidar Batsov] & [Dimitar Dimitrov]
for their interesting guest lectures and support for the class.

## The Students

We were a small, but really consistent and fun class. Thank you all for
participating and I hope you had as much fun as we did.
