Inspired by yesterday's lecture, we wanna give you a couple of testing
resources, we find interesting.

We'll start with a lecture [Radoslav Stankov] did at our [Core Ruby] class. The
lecture is called [Testing Ruby] and is a thorough introduction to a great deal
of testing concepts.

The next one is from [Martin Fowler] and its called [Mocks Aren't Stubs]
